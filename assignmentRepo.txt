(1)**USE CASES OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM**

    1. It is simple to use, because of its basic functionalities like saving and managing files without tampering with the previous versions.

    2. A developer can choose to save the progress of a particular project locally, yet allowing another developer to "pull" or access the source code.

    3. In the process of Software development, developers use version control system to isolate a particular file or code to what's called a "branch", before finally merging it. 


**GIT**

GIT is a Software for managing and tracking the source code of a project or several projects.

(2)**IMPORTANCE AND USES OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM**

    1. It is used to better organise our code when working on a team of Software developers.

    2. It allow teams to track and manage the source code of their projects.

    3. Developers can collaborate on a project from different locations.

    4. Version control system is used to store the progress of a particular project, incase a server goes down or the PC gets stolen, the source code will be saved to a secure remote server, given that the developer already pushed it.

    5. Version control system also increases productivity, as it allows many developers to work on project simultaneously.


(3)**TYPES OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM**

    1. Local Version Control(a local database on a local computer).

    2. Centralized Version Control

    3. Distributed Version Control(e.g GIT, Mercurial, Subversion, etc)
